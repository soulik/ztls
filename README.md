# ztls
ZeroMQ TLS proxy with mbedtls library

This project allows you to interconnect ZeroMQ network stack with SSL/TLS encrypted services.

## Architecture

All ztls endpoint use PAIR socket type. Keep in mind that ztls core runs in its own thread.

* Output endpoint - used to get/send data from/to the service
* Control endpoint (hidden at the moment) - used to manage proxy

A the moment there's only client side. Server side will come along in near future.

## Building

This project makes a heavy use of C++11 features (lambdas, threads, ...) so make sure that your compiler supports them.

You can build ztls with cmake build tool.

## API
* Initializers - return ztls context object pointer

``void * ztls_client_new(const char * endpoint_out, const char * endpoint_control);``

``void * ztls_client_new_with_ctx(void * zmq_context, const char * endpoint_out, const char * endpoint_control);``

* Set SSL/TLS connection host

``bool ztls_client_connect(void * state, const char * hostname, uint16_t port);``

* Set CA chain to allow certificate validation (expects PEM/DER format)

``bool ztls_client_CA_chain(void * state, const char * buffer, size_t len);``

* Send client initiated close command over SSL/TLS

``bool ztls_client_close(void * state);``

* Destroy ztls context

``bool ztls_client_destroy(void * state);``

## Examples

See http_client.cpp sample in tests/ directory.
