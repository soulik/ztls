# ztls
ZeroMQ TLS proxy with mbedtls library

This project allows you to interconnect ZeroMQ network stack with SSL/TLS encrypted services.

## Architecture

All ztls endpoint use PAIR socket type. Keep in mind that ztls core runs in its own thread.

* Input endpoint - usually connected to STREAM socket type - e.g.: HTTPS, IMAPs, POP3s service
* Output endpoint - used to get/send data from/to the service
* Control endpoint (hidden at the moment) - used to manage proxy

## Building

This project makes a heavy use of C++11 features (lambdas, threads, ...) so make sure that your compiler supports them.

## API
* Initializers - return ztls context object pointer

``void * ztls_client_init(const char * endpoint_in, const char * endpoint_out);``

``void * ztls_client_init_with_ctx(void * zmq_context, const char * endpoint_in, const char * endpoint_out);``

* Set SSL/TLS connection host

``bool ztls_client_connect(void * state, const char * hostname, char * error_message = nullptr, size_t max_error_message_length = 0);``

* Send client initiated close command over SSL/TLS

``bool ztls_client_close(void * state, char * error_message = nullptr, size_t max_error_message_length = 0);``

* Destroy ztls context

``bool ztls_client_destroy(void * state);``

## Examples

See http_client.cpp sample in tests/ directory.
